# Projection Pursuit Regression for Visual Receptive Field Analysis
===========================================================

This repository contains the exact implementation of the projection pursuit regression (PPR) algorithm used in:
* L. Liu, L. She, M. Chen, T. Liu, H.D. Lu, Y. Dan, & M. Poo, Spatial structure of neuronal receptive field in awake monkey secondary visual cortex (V2), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 113 (7) 1913-1918, https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1525505113 (2016).

## Description

* The PPR method is used to analyze the neuronal receptive fields using natural images for early visual area.
* The implementation uses MATLAB (tested with R2023b).
* Visual stimuli provided here were sampled from natural movies created by van Hateren (van Hateren JH, van der Schaaf A, 1998)
* For further details of the implementation, please refer to the original publication.

## Usage

To run the PPR algorithm on a model neuron, execute PPR_demo.m
